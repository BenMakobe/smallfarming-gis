Naming conventions:

SQL Statements should write reserved works in ALL CAPS for example:

``SELECT * FROM foo;``

Entity names should be singular for example:

``water_point`` not ``water_points``

Entity names should be lower case, underscore separated, for example:

``water_point`` not ``WaterPoint``

Lookup table names should be in lower case, for example:

``other`` not ``Other``
